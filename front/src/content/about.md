Human, half-nomad, long distance runner, climber, mountain lover and IT guy. In this space I talk about what I enjoyed doing, what I learned and where I failed. I do it for pleasure in French or English.

I do speak Arabic and Spanish too, but most of the time I mix all of them. Feel free to get in touch.

Currently in [Montpellier](https://goo.gl/maps/eoTjssrj7xXRrSGW6), south of France.
