Human nomad, runner, climber, programmer. I talk about experiences I enjoy or failures where I learn something new. I do it in French or English. I do speak Arabic and Spanish too, but most of the time I mix all of them.

Currently in [Montpellier](https://goo.gl/maps/eoTjssrj7xXRrSGW6), south of France.
